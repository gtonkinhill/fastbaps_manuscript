# Supplementary Material for the fastbaps manuscript

This repository contains supplementary material for the manuscript describing the fastbaps package. 

* 'supplementary_1.Rmd' contains code to compare the clusterings of snapclust, hierBAPS and fastbaps to a fasttree alignment. It contains the code to reproduce Figures 2 and 4 a,b from the manuscript.
* 'supplementary_2.Rmd' contains code to compare the run times and clustering results of the fastbaps algorithm on real datasets (except pneumococcal and HIV). It contains the code to reproduce Figure 4c as well as Tables 1 and 2.
* 'supplementary_3.Rmd' contains code to run and analyse the results of the simulations and reproduce Figure 3. It is not written to be run out of the box and may require some tweaking to get working on a new system.

Finally the scripts to run each of the algorithms for the timing and comparisons to a Fasttree phylogeny are available in the scripts sub-folder.
